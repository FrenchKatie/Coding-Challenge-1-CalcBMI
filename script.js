/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI, which is calcuated using this formula:
BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height).
(mass in KG, height in Metre).

1. Store Mark and John's height and mass in variables.
2. Calculate both their BMI's.
3. Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
4. Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3. (Something like "Is Marks BMI higher than John's? True").

var MarkMass = 119;
var MarkHeight = 190;

var JohnMass = 70;
var JohnHeight = 160;

console.log(MarkMass);
